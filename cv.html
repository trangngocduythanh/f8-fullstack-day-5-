                        Your resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages. Keep it
                        to 1 page if you have less than 8 years of professional
                        work experience. If you have more, you might consider
                        using 2 pages.

                    <p>
                        Include a skills section - it's incredibly important.
                        This step will prove highly valuable if the company uses
                        ATS (applicant tracking system).

                        Unless otherwise specified by the company or the job
                        description, submit your resume in pdf format. You can
                        convert this file to pdf in google docs by going to
                        File, select Download, and then pdf

                        the duration and relevance of the position. Keep
                        sections that are less relevant to the job you're

                        It's not enough to describe what you have done or your
                        areas of responsibility, you need to quantify the impact
                        of your work. Recruiters scan resumes for numbers, so
                        quantify as much as you can.

                        Or you could mention the increase in company revenue of
                        xx% that your work contributed to.

                    <p>
                        Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than 2
                        lines. No recruiter will read bullet points that are as
                        long as paragraphs.

                        Carefully review your resume several times to eliminate
                        any typos. Additionally, consider having someone else
                        proofread it to prevent sending an imperfect resume.

                        Be consistent with grammar. Generally, resumes should be
                        written in the past tense. The exception is if you're
                        describing your current position with ongoing
                        responsibilities.

                        If you're a fresh grad with limited work experience you
                        can move the education section to the top of the page.

                        If you have 5-8 years of work experience, do not include
                        internship experience in your resume unless highly
                        relevant.
